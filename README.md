Multilingual object detection, &lt;6MB. Works offline.

So yeah, this is a thing I made. It's a fully static website being served from s3, set up in such a way as to be an installable Progressive Web App, and all the code it uses fits in under six megabytes - well within the limits of modern service worker caching guidelines.

The upshot of all that is that once you've visited my website once, you get all the code needed for your device to do something cool and you never have to talk to me or my website again, ever.

I was inspired by my one year old, who is starting to be able to point at things and ask what they are. The floating labels and spoken language abilities really made this end up being something I'm proud of, that could maybe provide some use to someone.

At the end of the day, there are probably other apps that do this task better, but it's cool that any phone that runs Chrome can do this type of thing locally.
