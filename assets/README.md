# Assets

Outside of `styles.css`, which was written by me, most of these are icons and such. The base icon was taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/question-circle?style=regular), and I manually modified the resulting svg using colors picked out from [coolors.co](https://coolors.co). You should definitely check out the svg file if you're interested; I had never peeked inside one before and it was quite illuminating.

Anyways, the bulk of the icons come from using that svg on [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and tweaking a couple of options as I went through.
